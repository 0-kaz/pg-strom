* Fri Dec 15 2023 KaiGai Kohei <kaigai@heterodb.com> - 5.0-1
- The code base has been re-designed entirely with various improvement.
- Process model was revised to concentrate GPU resource management to
  multi-threaded background worker process (PG-Strom GPU Service).
  Unlike v3.x or older, this new design reduces GPU resource consumption
  and overhead of task-switching.
- GPU device code in v5.0 operates individual tasks according to the pseudo
  code (called 'kexp') generated from the supplied SQL clauses. Unlike v3.x or
  older, it never generates CUDA C++ native code (thus, run-time compiler
  stuff by NVRTC was removed).
  It improves agility of query execution, and helps software quality assurance
  due to code stability. It is also a groundwork for the future support of CSD
  (computational storage drives), DPU (data processing unit) or others.
- GPU-Cache is now built on CUDA managed memory that allows memory
  overcommit, larger than the physical size of GPU DRAM.
- xPU device type definition was modified to optimize for wide-band GPU
  memory with utilization of coleasced memory access. kvec_datum_t (or its
  inherited) type internally declared with small array for each fields to access
  these values simultaneously.
- gpupreagg tends to use GPU shared memory for more lightweight aggregation
  as long as number of groups are less than the capacity.
- gpujoin extracts tuples once per depth, unlike v3.x or older.
- partition-wise gpujoin is still works-in-progress, so we will re-activate
  the feature at v5.1.
- ...and fixed various bugs.
